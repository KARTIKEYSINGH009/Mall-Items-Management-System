**Project Statement: Mall Items Management System**

## 1. Problem Definition

In a typical shopping mall, managing and tracking various items manually often leads to inefficiencies such as pricing errors, inventory confusion, and delayed customer service. Without a digital system, handling product listings and customer billing becomes time-consuming and prone to mistakes. This project aims to address these challenges by developing a small-scale, menu-driven application that simplifies item management and checkout operations.

## 2. Objective

The objective of the Mall Items Management System is to automate basic retail operations through a Python-based solution. The system allows the user to add items, view available products, create a shopping cart, remove items, and calculate the total bill instantly. It demonstrates practical implementation of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like inheritance and data encapsulation.

## 3. Scope

The project covers the design and development of a console-based management system focused on single-session transactions. It is intended for small-scale retail environments, academic use, or demonstration purposes. The system does not require external databases and operates entirely through in-memory data structures.

## 4. Target Users

* Small store or mall owners who want a lightweight digital inventory system.
* Students and learners exploring basic programming and OOP concepts.
* Academic evaluators assessing problem-solving and programming skills.

## 5. Tools and Technologies

* **Programming Language:** Python 3.8+
* **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
* **Version Control:** Git and GitHub

## 6. Expected Outcome

* A fully functional command-line application that manages mall items and customer carts.
* Demonstration of modular code design using classes and inheritance.
* Improved understanding of object-oriented principles and data handling in Python.
