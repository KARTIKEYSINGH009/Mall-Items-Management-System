Mall Items Management System

Mall Items Management System is a simple Python application that models how a retail or mall environment manages its product listings and shopping cart. It provides a menu-based console interface that allows users to browse available items, add them to a virtual cart, view their selections, and check the total bill amount.

This project was developed as part of the Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming course at VIT Bhopal University.

2.Add or remove products from the cart

3.Display cart details and calculate total amount

4.Easy-to-use menu-driven interface

5.Built using clean, object-oriented Python design
